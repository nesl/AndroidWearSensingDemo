About this project:

This is a demo for transmitting sensor data from the Android Wear to an Android smartphone.
It allows for bluetooth streaming to the android device (assuming both are paired and the phone has Wear OS)

Streamed data is saved to the mobile device's Documents/WEARABLE_DATA/RAW.txt
You can take this file and parse it using Parser/parser.py.  It will create
4 different csv files for each sensor.
